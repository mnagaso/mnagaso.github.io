because the limitation of file I/O bandwidth blocks the other computing processes.
To avoid this waiting time, I implemented an advanced way of using multi-processors, i.e. preparing some I/O dedicated nodes (we call this I/O server) then the computing process may only do their computation while actual I/O processes are done on only the I/O servers, which realize asynchronous I/O.

I was developing an Gui application for downloading, pre/post-processing, configurating a set of files/scripts for running a full wave inversion and shipping the massive seismic observation data to HPC and computation clusters.
