because the limitation of file I/O bandwidth blocks the other computing processes.
For avoid this waiting time, I implemented an advanced way of using multi-processors, i.e. preparing some I/O dedicated nodes (we call this I/O server) then the computing process may do only their computation while actual I/O processes are done on only the I/O servers, which realize an asynchronous I/O.</p><h2 id=full-wave-inversion-and-development-of-prepost-processing-tool-for-massive-amount-of-seismic-observation-data>Full wave inversion and development of pre/post processing tool for massive amount of seismic observation data.</h2><p>This is the project (part of my postdoc works) to realize a seismic tomography using Spectral Element Method and Full wave inversion for studying the subsurface structure of Japanese islands.
I am developing an Gui application for downloading, pre/post-processing, configurating a set of files/scripts for running a full wave inversion and shipping the massive seismic observation data to HPC and computation clusters.
