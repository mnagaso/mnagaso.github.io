Workin as a lead developer of an open-source code project TomoATT, which is a library for eikonal equation based adjoint-state travel time tomography, optimized for a use on HPCs (implemented with MPI, MPI-SHMEM, GPU with SIMD optimization, and parallel-HDF5, containerlized with Docker and Singularity).

Language English (fluent) French (intermediate) Japanese (native) Experience 01.jan.2024 - present Postdoctoral research fellow Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO, USA Development of Global Full-Waveform Inversion model and libraries (part of NSF SCOPED project). Studying on:
I/O bottleneck towards Exa-scale HPC era. e.g. application of Asynchronous I/O, Lossy compression etc., an adaptable filtering technique for in-ocean seismometer system (MERMAIDS), and application of them all to FWI calculation.</description></item></channel></rss>
