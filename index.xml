Eikonal-based solver for calculating travel times is computationally much lighter than full-waveform inversion. By using this method, we will try to achieve a tomographic image of the Earth structure with a very high resolution. The aim of this project is to develop a numerical library for making the calculation of adjoint-state travel-time tomography, but not only the solver, which is well optimized for the use on HPCs of Exascale-era.</description></item><item><title>Resume</title><link>https://mnagaso.github.io/resume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mnagaso.github.io/resume/</guid><description>Personal date Name: Masaru NAGASO
